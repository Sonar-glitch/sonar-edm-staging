# Sonar EDM Platform - Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing all the fixes and improvements in the Sonar EDM Platform.

## Overview

The Sonar EDM Platform has been completely redesigned with:
1. Modern dark neon UI aesthetic
2. Fixed authentication system (Spotify for music fans, Google for promoters)
3. Improved music taste analysis functionality
4. Enhanced analytics dashboards
5. Separate pages for promoters and users with combined analytics

## Implementation Steps

### 1. File Structure

All the fixed and improved files are located in the `/home/ubuntu/sonar-edm-fixes/` directory. These files should replace their counterparts in the original repository.

### 2. Authentication Configuration

Update your environment variables in `.env` file:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=random_string_for_encryption
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_app_url
```

### 3. Deployment Process

1. Replace all files in your repository with the fixed versions
2. Push the changes to your GitHub repository
3. Deploy to Heroku using either:
   - Heroku CLI: `git push heroku main`
   - Heroku Dashboard: Connect to your GitHub repository and deploy

### 4. Post-Deployment Configuration

1. Update callback URLs in Spotify Developer Dashboard:
   - Add: `https://your-app-url/api/auth/callback/spotify`

2. Update callback URLs in Google Cloud Console:
   - Add: `https://your-app-url/api/auth/callback/google`

## Maintenance and Future Development

For future development:
1. Consider implementing real-time data updates using WebSockets
2. Add more personalized recommendations based on user preferences
3. Expand analytics capabilities with more detailed metrics
4. Implement A/B testing for UI elements
