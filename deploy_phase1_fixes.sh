✅ Fix #1: Real Data Labels
- Updated data status logic to check actual content, not HTTP codes
- Fixes false 'Real Data' labels on cached/demo responses
- Accurate Spotify and taste profile data indicators

✅ Fix #2: Event Sorting Enhancement  
- Added 3-level sorting: source → match score → date
- Real events prioritized over emergency fallbacks
- Recent events appear first for same match scores
- Better user experience with most relevant events at top

✅ Fix #3: Duplicate Header Removal
- Added hideHeader prop to EnhancedPersonalizedDashboard
- Conditional header rendering prevents duplicates
- Preserves space-saving design and glassmorphic styling
- Ready for tab navigation integration

Impact: Improved data transparency, better event discovery, cleaner UI"
