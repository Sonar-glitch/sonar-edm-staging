## Implementation Recommendations
Based on the analysis of the current project state, here are recommendations for implementing the requested features:

### 1. Implement Side-by-Side Layout
- Create a SideBySideLayout component that arranges two components horizontally
- Modify dashboard.js to use this layout for sound characteristics and seasonal vibes
- Ensure responsive behavior for mobile devices

### 2. Create CompactSeasonalVibes Component
- Create a modified version of the SeasonalVibes component without the heading
- Place year-round vibes at the top
- Ensure it works well in the side-by-side layout

### 3. Enhance Event List
- Create an EnhancedEventList component that shows DJs in order of match score
- Include venue addresses
- Add "Live Data" or "Sample" badges to distinguish real events from mockups
- Implement an expand button for showing all DJs when there are many

### 4. Create Mobile-Optimized Vibe Quiz
- Implement a 5-card format with at least 6 input options per card
- Ensure state preservation
- Save selections to user profile with higher weightage
- Show completion indicator when at least 1 option from each category is selected


## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the TIKO platform's current state and the implementation status of requested features. Use this report as a guide for implementing the remaining features in a way that integrates seamlessly with the existing project structure.

For future tasks, this report should be regenerated to reflect the current state of the project and track progress on feature implementation.
